Variable=Value correct way
Variable = Value Incorrect way

echo "Value is $Variable" : It would print variable value
echo 'Value is $Variable' : It would print the same string (not the variable value)

If I define a script.sh and define a function, 

then do a source script.sh, it would register the function

then do functionname argument, it would execute the function and perform the desired function

$0: would give the script name
$1-$9 : would give argument names
$?: Will get you the error code for the previous command
$_ : Last argument of previous command

$@ - All the arguments
$# - Number of arguments
$$ - Process identification number (PID) for the current script
!! - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing sudo !!
