Variable=Value correct way
Variable = Value Incorrect way

echo "Value is $Variable" : It would print variable value
echo 'Value is $Variable' : It would print the same string (not the variable value)

If I define a script.sh and define a function, 

then do a source script.sh, it would register the function

then do functionname argument, it would execute the function and perform the desired function

$0: would give the script name
$1-$9 : would give argument names
$?: Will get you the error code for the previous command
