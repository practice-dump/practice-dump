THere are two streams to terminal.
    Input : By default keyboard
    Output : By default terminal screen
Using <> we can change that

> : is used as argument, which tells system where to store output. echo "Azaadi" > firstfile.txt. It would create a file named firstfile and store "Azaadi"
< : is used as argument, which tells system where to take input from. echo < firstfile.txt would display "Azaadi" on screen
>> : is used as argument, which works similar to > but this time we append information

| is used to chain multiple commands
first command | second command. SO the first command would be executed, the input to second command would be output of first command
