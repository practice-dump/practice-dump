4 Commerical models

  * Mistral small : Suitable for simple tasks that one can do in bulk (Classification, Customer Support, or Text Generation)
  * Mistral medium : deal for intermediate tasks that require moderate reasoning (Data extraction, Summarizing a Document, Writing emails, Writing a Job Description, or Writing Product Descriptions) **** Would be deprecated soon
  * Mistral Large : flagship model that's ideal for complex tasks that require large reasoning capabilities or are highly specialized (Synthetic Text Generation, Code Generation, RAG, or Agents). 
  * Mistral embedding : A model that converts text into numerical vectors of embeddings in 1024 dimensions. Embedding models enable retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation applications. It achieves a retrieval score of 55.26 on MTEB.
