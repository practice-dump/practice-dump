8 Feed forward neural networks. At the time of inference, a gating mechanism decides the two experts. The weighted output of two experts is taken to generate next token

The model has 46.7 billions parameters but at the time of inference the model only uses 12.9 billions parameters only.

Benefits:

* Performance of large model
* Inference comparable to smaller model
